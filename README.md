strongloop-angular-seed
=======================

This is a base seed for a full stack of [LoopBack](http://loopback.io/), [StrongLoop](http://strongloop.com/), [Angular](https://angularjs.org/), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) with [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)

Version 0.0.1

WARNING
-------

this is work in progress at the moment...

please come back in a couple of days... - or use on your own risk. Pull requests welcome!

### Inspiration

You should know, that there is a [LoopBack](http://loopback.io/) [Full-Stack Example](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-example-full-stack). You can clone it and see a [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) example.

For me it was a good source of inspiration. Thank You!

#### Differences

- use [less](http://lesscss.org/) for CSS instead of [sass](http://sass-lang.com/) - so you don't need ruby but are not limited to pure CSS
- use [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) for Angular (and later for LoopBack)

### Why build another seed?

*Short answer:*

Because I use it in my live projects.

*Long answer:*

I can't find any generator, seed oder example that fullfill all my needs, especially for my live projects. So I start my own one and share it to you. Comments, recommendations and pull request are welcome.
